## ✨ Core Features

- ✅ **Ensemble Methodology**: Combines predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy and handle data sparsity.
- ✅ **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes **SVD** (`Singular Value Decomposition`) to capture latent user-item interactions.
- ✅ **Content-Based Filtering**: Employs **BERT** embeddings to understand product semantics and recommend similar items.
- ✅ **Sentiment-Enhanced Recommendations**: Integrates sentiment analysis scores as a feature to filter out negatively reviewed products.
- ✅ **Advanced Ranking Model**: Uses an **XGBoost** model to rank candidate recommendations based on a rich set of features.
- ✅ **Deep Learning Approach**: Implements **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)** for a deep learning perspective on recommendations.
- ✅ **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit** allowing for easy interaction and recommendation filtering.

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

The recommendation pipeline follows a multi-stage process to generate the final ranked list for a user:

1.  **Candidate Generation**: A set of initial product candidates is generated using both **SVD** (for collaborative signals) and **BERT-based content similarity** (for item semantics).
2.  **Feature Engineering**: For each user-candidate pair, a feature vector is constructed. This includes:
    - The prediction scores from SVD and BERT.
    - Sentiment analysis scores for the product.
    - Other user and item metadata.
3.  **Ranking**: The **XGBoost** model takes these feature vectors as input and predicts a final relevance score for each candidate product.
4.  **Final Output**: The products are sorted based on their XGBoost scores, and the top-N recommendations are presented to the user. The **NCF** model serves as an alternative deep-learning-based pipeline for comparison and ensembling.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://[your-github-repo-url]
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    _Note: On the first run, the application will automatically download the necessary models and data files from Google Drive._

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Launch the Streamlit app from your terminal:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
