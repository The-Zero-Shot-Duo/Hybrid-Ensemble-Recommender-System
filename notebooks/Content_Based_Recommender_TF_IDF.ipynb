A line-by-line parser will fail to interpret this correctly, thinking the object has ended prematurely. This leads to parsing errors and results in null values for those records."

It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student/writers' workshop \\\"my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me\\\" trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are.\\nAnyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature.\\nI was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh...\\nI hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work. Pages and pages of introspection, in the style of writers like Henry James.  I like this kind of  novels and the writer occasionally delights me with her descriptions and observations.  But it's way too repetitious for me and, I think, some parts could have been cut out while still preserving, and probably more tightly crystallizing, the themes and \\\"truths\\\" within the story.\\n\\nIt's a story I could relate to but I wish it hadn't been too tedious to read. This is the kind of novel to read when you have time to lose yourself in a book for days, possibly weeks. I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.\\n\\nPotential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.\\n\\nThe focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.\\n\\nSagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.\\n\\n It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.\\n\\nFor me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family. What gorgeous language! What an incredible writer! The Last Life is one of  the best written novels I have ever read. This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism.\\nThe story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it! I was taken in by reviews that compared this book with The Leopard or promised a bildungsroman set in a family that is isolated and on the move.  Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the \\\"bildung?\\\"  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.\\nI do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.\\nIf you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend.\",\n          \"This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.  The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.  Horrible, just horrible design.  I'm skipping this and paying double for a refurbished Synergy V. Worked out of the box with my cable box in northern California. Better than the original. It was easy to program for the tv too. I have an older URC-WR7 remote and thought this would be an upgrade (and because TWC stuck me with it), but this one fails where the other one didn't.  The old remote could go head to head and learn.  I have 2 different Blu Ray players (LG & Panasonic) and this one fails on both.  It cannot learn buttons.  The biggest problem is in streaming when I need to hit the blue, red, yellow, green buttons.  These cannot work either of them, so I have to pull out the remote for that one setting.  I don't know why they give you multiple code methods but no learning. Works great! Cool Came with a \\\"bright house networks\\\" logo, but worked on Time Warner box perfectly. very nice.... Works great First time I've EVER had a remote that needed no programming whatsoever so I have to give it bragging rights.  All the other 8780Ls I've had certainly had to be set up first.\\n\\nYes I wish it was Silver or White or some color that would permit its buttons to be more easily read but its thinner in hand than the ATLAS OCAP 5-Device Cable Remote Control 1056B03 so its the best thing I can find for a Samsung DVR with Samsung TV on the TWC system in NY. volume buttons do not work. Got them and only 2 of them worked. company called me after the feedback and told me they would send me a refund. The 2 that are working are doing fine. I like the lighted feature a lot for the night time. Works like it should I got tired of the remote being on the wrong side of the bed. I was going to buy a generic remote when I got the idea to look for the real thing.  For a few bucks more I got this one. It is the same one as Time Warner gives you, works exactly the same, don't have to relearn anything. Volume buttons were dead on arrival. be aware of possible defects!! Works fine easy to program Perfect backup for existing TWC remote This remote is the perfect solution for controlling my TWC cable box with DVR and my Visio TV, Sony Blu-ray player and Denon AVR. It was easy (15 - 20 minutes) to program the remote to control all this equipment. Still need to use my Visio remote to access Netflix and Amazon Video, but otherwise the TWC remote works great! excellent!  delivery was immediate. Came on time, fair price, and comparatively easy to set up. TWC took the old one and would not return it, and their \\\"replacement\\\" clicker is useless. This works fine! worked. cheap. Works just like the rental unit supplied by the cable company.  In fact it is identical.  Just what I was looking for. great awesome product I love the remote, my old remote was going bad and I looked everywhere trying to find something, finally I decided to look online and I found the exact same kind, and they work great with my tv, I got one for my parents also. Great remote. GREAT PRICE... GREAT REMOTE An excellent product/price, and super-fast shipping. It's ok. Feels somewhat awkward in hand. SMALL buttons on the bottom, great if your an elf. Perfect replacement for the last one my dog chewed up. It works perfect and even came with some cheap batteries. It arrived quickly and was double packed inside a heavily padded envelope. Will buy again if my dog gets ahold of this one! Had to replace my old TWC remote as some of the buttons wouldn't work. This is a bit upgraded and works just as good My old Time Warner remote was causing me to pull my hair out. Bought this and has worked like a charm. All along I thought my TWC box was to blame and all I had was a defective remote. Should TWC have provided me a replacement? Yes. But this was much faster and works great. It works. It's interesting, I got one assembled in Mexico and it recently started to not work without a hard push on the buttons.\\n\\nThis one, identical in every way, is assembled in Korea. Seems to be better made.\\n\\nGo figure.\\n\\nBut, it works,,,, I am happy IT WORKS WONDERFUL......... Works just fine, quick delivery. Saved a bundle buying this from Amazon and not the cable company.  Works great! It works but the button layout is terrible.  Half the time the wrong button gets pressed - annoying. Functions just a good as the original.\",\n          \"I read this probably 50 years ago in my youth and I just re-read it for the first time.  It was a fun read but not as good as my memory of it.\\n\\nBarry I read every Perry mason book voraciously. Finding the Lam/Cool mysteries, and getting to enjoy more of Gardner's characters, is like Christmas morning as a kid. Each book is a gift! I love this series of Bertha and Lamb..  Great novels. Great read! Crows Can't Count, A.A. Fair\\n\\nMr. Harry Sharples came to the Cool & Lam Agency; he was a co-trustee for a trust fund that will terminate when the youngest beneficiary turns 25. One of the heirs, Robert Hockley, is wild and gambles. The other, Shirley Bruce, isn't but refuses to take more than the other. A large part of the estate is in Colombian emerald mines. A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).\\n\\nLam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow's nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12). The police bring Lam to Sharples' residence. His office is disordered as from a struggle, and Sharples is missing (Chapter 15). Lam meets George Prenter on the airplane, and hears of the wonderful life and climate in Medellin Colombia (Chapter 16). A visitor surprises Lam and we learn the true facts behind the earlier events (Chapter 17). Lam learns that someone else has been killed (Chapter 19).\\n\\nLam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and \\\"the delightful Senora Cool\\\" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25). [Do you remember the story of King Solomon and the disputed child?] The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place, just as the apple falls close to its tree (Chapter 26). One benefit of this story is the description of the trip to Colombia. I read this book about 40 years ago, and it still holds up nicely for me. I will definitely dive into more Cool/Lam mysteries.\\n\\nTwo notes: a recent paper showed that crows can count to 3, but not to 4.\\n\\nThe Kindle edition had about half a dozen punctuation errors.

It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student/writers' workshop \\\"my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me\\\" trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are.\\nAnyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature.\\nI was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh...\\nI hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work. Pages and pages of introspection, in the style of writers like Henry James.  I like this kind of  novels and the writer occasionally delights me with her descriptions and observations.  But it's way too repetitious for me and, I think, some parts could have been cut out while still preserving, and probably more tightly crystallizing, the themes and \\\"truths\\\" within the story.\\n\\nIt's a story I could relate to but I wish it hadn't been too tedious to read. This is the kind of novel to read when you have time to lose yourself in a book for days, possibly weeks. I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.\\n\\nPotential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.\\n\\nThe focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.\\n\\nSagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.\\n\\n It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.\\n\\nFor me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family. What gorgeous language! What an incredible writer! The Last Life is one of  the best written novels I have ever read. This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism.\\nThe story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it! I was taken in by reviews that compared this book with The Leopard or promised a bildungsroman set in a family that is isolated and on the move.  Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the \\\"bildung?\\\"  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.\\nI do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.\\nIf you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend.\",\n          \"This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.  The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.  Horrible, just horrible design.  I'm skipping this and paying double for a refurbished Synergy V. Worked out of the box with my cable box in northern California. Better than the original. It was easy to program for the tv too. I have an older URC-WR7 remote and thought this would be an upgrade (and because TWC stuck me with it), but this one fails where the other one didn't.  The old remote could go head to head and learn.  I have 2 different Blu Ray players (LG & Panasonic) and this one fails on both.  It cannot learn buttons.  The biggest problem is in streaming when I need to hit the blue, red, yellow, green buttons.  These cannot work either of them, so I have to pull out the remote for that one setting.  I don't know why they give you multiple code methods but no learning. Works great! Cool Came with a \\\"bright house networks\\\" logo, but worked on Time Warner box perfectly. very nice.... Works great First time I've EVER had a remote that needed no programming whatsoever so I have to give it bragging rights.  All the other 8780Ls I've had certainly had to be set up first.\\n\\nYes I wish it was Silver or White or some color that would permit its buttons to be more easily read but its thinner in hand than the ATLAS OCAP 5-Device Cable Remote Control 1056B03 so its the best thing I can find for a Samsung DVR with Samsung TV on the TWC system in NY. volume buttons do not work. Got them and only 2 of them worked. company called me after the feedback and told me they would send me a refund. The 2 that are working are doing fine. I like the lighted feature a lot for the night time. Works like it should I got tired of the remote being on the wrong side of the bed. I was going to buy a generic remote when I got the idea to look for the real thing.  For a few bucks more I got this one. It is the same one as Time Warner gives you, works exactly the same, don't have to relearn anything. Volume buttons were dead on arrival. be aware of possible defects!! Works fine easy to program Perfect backup for existing TWC remote This remote is the perfect solution for controlling my TWC cable box with DVR and my Visio TV, Sony Blu-ray player and Denon AVR. It was easy (15 - 20 minutes) to program the remote to control all this equipment. Still need to use my Visio remote to access Netflix and Amazon Video, but otherwise the TWC remote works great! excellent!  delivery was immediate. Came on time, fair price, and comparatively easy to set up. TWC took the old one and would not return it, and their \\\"replacement\\\" clicker is useless. This works fine! worked. cheap. Works just like the rental unit supplied by the cable company.  In fact it is identical.  Just what I was looking for. great awesome product I love the remote, my old remote was going bad and I looked everywhere trying to find something, finally I decided to look online and I found the exact same kind, and they work great with my tv, I got one for my parents also. Great remote. GREAT PRICE... GREAT REMOTE An excellent product/price, and super-fast shipping. It's ok. Feels somewhat awkward in hand. SMALL buttons on the bottom, great if your an elf. Perfect replacement for the last one my dog chewed up. It works perfect and even came with some cheap batteries. It arrived quickly and was double packed inside a heavily padded envelope. Will buy again if my dog gets ahold of this one! Had to replace my old TWC remote as some of the buttons wouldn't work. This is a bit upgraded and works just as good My old Time Warner remote was causing me to pull my hair out. Bought this and has worked like a charm. All along I thought my TWC box was to blame and all I had was a defective remote. Should TWC have provided me a replacement? Yes. But this was much faster and works great. It works. It's interesting, I got one assembled in Mexico and it recently started to not work without a hard push on the buttons.\\n\\nThis one, identical in every way, is assembled in Korea. Seems to be better made.\\n\\nGo figure.\\n\\nBut, it works,,,, I am happy IT WORKS WONDERFUL......... Works just fine, quick delivery. Saved a bundle buying this from Amazon and not the cable company.  Works great! It works but the button layout is terrible.  Half the time the wrong button gets pressed - annoying. Functions just a good as the original.\",\n          \"I read this probably 50 years ago in my youth and I just re-read it for the first time.

One of the heirs, Robert Hockley, is wild and gambles. The other, Shirley Bruce, isn't but refuses to take more than the other. A large part of the estate is in Colombian emerald mines. A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).\\n\\nLam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow's nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12). The police bring Lam to Sharples' residence. His office is disordered as from a struggle, and Sharples is missing (Chapter 15). Lam meets George Prenter on the airplane, and hears of the wonderful life and climate in Medellin Colombia (Chapter 16). A visitor surprises Lam and we learn the true facts behind the earlier events (Chapter 17). Lam learns that someone else has been killed (Chapter 19).\\n\\nLam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and \\\"the delightful Senora Cool\\\" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25). [Do you remember the story of King Solomon and the disputed child?] The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place, just as the apple falls close to its tree (Chapter 26). One benefit of this story is the description of the trip to Colombia. I read this book about 40 years ago, and it still holds up nicely for me. I will definitely dive into more Cool/Lam mysteries.\\n\\nTwo notes: a recent paper showed that crows can count to 3, but not to 4.\\n\\nThe Kindle edition had about half a dozen punctuation errors. Old-time pulps generally got that right.  Kindle app could have a button labeled \\\"this page needs editing.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student/writers' workshop \\\"my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me\\\" trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are.\\nAnyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature.\\nI was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh...\\nI hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work. Pages and pages of introspection, in the style of writers like Henry James.  I like this kind of  novels and the writer occasionally delights me with her descriptions and observations.  But it's way too repetitious for me and, I think, some parts could have been cut out while still preserving, and probably more tightly crystallizing, the themes and \\\"truths\\\" within the story.\\n\\nIt's a story I could relate to but I wish it hadn't been too tedious to read. This is the kind of novel to read when you have time to lose yourself in a book for days, possibly weeks. I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.\\n\\nPotential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.\\n\\nThe focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.\\n\\nSagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.\\n\\n It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.\\n\\nFor me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family. What gorgeous language! What an incredible writer! The Last Life is one of  the best written novels I have ever read. This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism.\\nThe story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it! I was taken in by reviews that compared this book with The Leopard or promised a bildungsroman set in a family that is isolated and on the move.  Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the \\\"bildung?\\\"  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.\\nI do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.\\nIf you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend.\",\n          \"This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.  The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.  Horrible, just horrible design.  I'm skipping this and paying double for a refurbished Synergy V. Worked out of the box with my cable box in northern California. Better than the original. It was easy to program for the tv too. I have an older URC-WR7 remote and thought this would be an upgrade (and because TWC stuck me with it), but this one fails where the other one didn't.  The old remote could go head to head and learn.  I have 2 different Blu Ray players (LG & Panasonic) and this one fails on both.  It cannot learn buttons.  The biggest problem is in streaming when I need to hit the blue, red, yellow, green buttons.  These cannot work either of them, so I have to pull out the remote for that one setting.  I don't know why they give you multiple code methods but no learning. Works great! Cool Came with a \\\"bright house networks\\\" logo, but worked on Time Warner box perfectly. very nice.... Works great First time I've EVER had a remote that needed no programming whatsoever so I have to give it bragging rights.  All the other 8780Ls I've had certainly had to be set up first.\\n\\nYes I wish it was Silver or White or some color that would permit its buttons to be more easily read but its thinner in hand than the ATLAS OCAP 5-Device Cable Remote Control 1056B03 so its the best thing I can find for a Samsung DVR with Samsung TV on the TWC system in NY. volume buttons do not work. Got them and only 2 of them worked. company called me after the feedback and told me they would send me a refund. The 2 that are working are doing fine. I like the lighted feature a lot for the night time. Works like it should I got tired of the remote being on the wrong side of the bed. I was going to buy a generic remote when I got the idea to look for the real thing.  For a few bucks more I got this one. It is the same one as Time Warner gives you, works exactly the same, don't have to relearn anything. Volume buttons were dead on arrival. be aware of possible defects!! Works fine easy to program Perfect backup for existing TWC remote This remote is the perfect solution for controlling my TWC cable box with DVR and my Visio TV, Sony Blu-ray player and Denon AVR. It was easy (15 - 20 minutes) to program the remote to control all this equipment. Still need to use my Visio remote to access Netflix and Amazon Video, but otherwise the TWC remote works great! excellent!  delivery was immediate. Came on time, fair price, and comparatively easy to set up. TWC took the old one and would not return it, and their \\\"replacement\\\" clicker is useless. This works fine! worked. cheap. Works just like the rental unit supplied by the cable company.  In fact it is identical.  Just what I was looking for. great awesome product I love the remote, my old remote was going bad and I looked everywhere trying to find something, finally I decided to look online and I found the exact same kind, and they work great with my tv, I got one for my parents also. Great remote. GREAT PRICE... GREAT REMOTE An excellent product/price, and super-fast shipping. It's ok. Feels somewhat awkward in hand. SMALL buttons on the bottom, great if your an elf. Perfect replacement for the last one my dog chewed up. It works perfect and even came with some cheap batteries. It arrived quickly and was double packed inside a heavily padded envelope. Will buy again if my dog gets ahold of this one! Had to replace my old TWC remote as some of the buttons wouldn't work. This is a bit upgraded and works just as good My old Time Warner remote was causing me to pull my hair out. Bought this and has worked like a charm. All along I thought my TWC box was to blame and all I had was a defective remote. Should TWC have provided me a replacement? Yes. But this was much faster and works great. It works. It's interesting, I got one assembled in Mexico and it recently started to not work without a hard push on the buttons.\\n\\nThis one, identical in every way, is assembled in Korea. Seems to be better made.\\n\\nGo figure.\\n\\nBut, it works,,,, I am happy IT WORKS WONDERFUL......... Works just fine, quick delivery. Saved a bundle buying this from Amazon and not the cable company.  Works great! It works but the button layout is terrible.  Half the time the wrong button gets pressed - annoying. Functions just a good as the original.\",\n          \"I read this probably 50 years ago in my youth and I just re-read it for the first time.  It was a fun read but not as good as my memory of it.\\n\\nBarry I read every Perry mason book voraciously. Finding the Lam/Cool mysteries, and getting to enjoy more of Gardner's characters, is like Christmas morning as a kid. Each book is a gift! I love this series of Bertha and Lamb..  Great novels. Great read! Crows Can't Count, A.A. Fair\\n\\nMr. Harry Sharples came to the Cool & Lam Agency; he was a co-trustee for a trust fund that will terminate when the youngest beneficiary turns 25. One of the heirs, Robert Hockley, is wild and gambles. The other, Shirley Bruce, isn't but refuses to take more than the other. A large part of the estate is in Colombian emerald mines. A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).\\n\\nLam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow's nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12). The police bring Lam to Sharples' residence. His office is disordered as from a struggle, and Sharples is missing (Chapter 15). Lam meets George Prenter on the airplane, and hears of the wonderful life and climate in Medellin Colombia (Chapter 16). A visitor surprises Lam and we learn the true facts behind the earlier events (Chapter 17). Lam learns that someone else has been killed (Chapter 19).\\n\\nLam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and \\\"the delightful Senora Cool\\\" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25). [Do you remember the story of King Solomon and the disputed child?] The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place, just as the apple falls close to its tree (Chapter 26). One benefit of this story is the description of the trip to Colombia. I read this book about 40 years ago, and it still holds up nicely for me. I will definitely dive into more Cool/Lam mysteries.\\n\\nTwo notes: a recent paper showed that crows can count to 3, but not to 4.\\n\\nThe Kindle edition had about half a dozen punctuation errors.
